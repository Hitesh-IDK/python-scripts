# Python-Scripts
Just some random python scripts. Some are useful and some are just for fun.
These are my attempts at learning python and trying to make a good use of it to automate my computer experiences. If you find some of these scripts useful, feel free to download them.

### Download Packer
This script makes sure that your downloads folder is kept clean by automatically re-organizing all your files into meaningful directories.
Directories used - Documents, Media (*Audio, Video, Photos*), Zip Files, Installers and Others (*Other folders and files*)

### Download Unpacker
A Sequel of download packer, if you didnt like the way it packed the files, or you just want to go back to your regular old messy downloads folder, this script will undo it.
Note : *Only works if the packing is done similar to my download packer*

### WarCards 
Implementation of war cards, where the values of cards are compared and the winner gets the cards. First person to have no cards loses.
In my script the computer plays against itself.

### BlackJack
A simple implementation of blackjack, with only 2 actions - Hit and Stay.
The dealer is a computer that makes decisions based on a random generator.

### Tic Tac - X's and O's
The classic game for every programmer. 
A 3x3 grid playground for X and O's for a 2 player game
